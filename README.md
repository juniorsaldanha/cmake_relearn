# Remembering some basics of cmake after a long time without doing my self from scratch

- CMakeLists.txt it will (re)generate the Makefile for actually build the your program (if needed)
- Every time that you change the CMakeLists.txt and run `make` it will (re)generate the Makefile
- You have to remember to add the dir's of the headers file that must be included
- You have to remember to add any file or subfolder of non-header files to be compiled

# That's it. This is a remember for the Junior of the future. Keep coding.
